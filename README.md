# Gully Predict 2026 — Premium Prediction Platform

A sophisticated, private Gully Predict Cricket prediction platform for competitive friend groups. Features a robust FastAPI backend, a high-performance React frontend, multi-league architecture, dynamic AI-powered campaigns, and automated match result processing.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🏆 Multi-League & Campaign System
- **Tournament-Based Architecture**: Matches belong to a Tournament (e.g., IPL 2026). Multiple private Leagues exist within each Tournament.
- **Time-Bound Scoring**: League points only count from matches/campaigns that locked after the user's `joined_at` timestamp in that league.
- **Dynamic Campaigns**: Admins create "Master" (global) or league-specific campaigns with flexible question types. Campaigns must be explicitly marked as `Active` to appear on user prediction forms and to be scored.
- **Rich Question Types**: Multiple choice, toggle, dropdown, free text, numeric inputs with configurable scoring tiers.
- **Advanced Scoring**: Per-question scoring rules (exact match, numeric difference, multi-choice tiers).
- **League-Scoped Reveal**: Community predictions are segmented by league — users only see predictions from members of their shared leagues.

### 🎮 Gamification & AI
- **AI Assassin**: Autonomous competitor (`ai_assassin@ipl.fantasy`) that makes heuristic predictions. Non-participation penalty starts from Match 25 onwards.
- **Powerups**: 2× score multiplier applicable to Winner, Player of the Match, and Powerplay predictions. Sixes/Fours categories are excluded from the multiplier.
- **Match Center**: Unified dashboard with today's matches, upcoming fixtures, and a live indicator.
- **Hall of Fame**: "Sixster" and "Fourster" badges awarded to users with high accuracy on team prediction categories.

### 📊 Performance Analytics
- **Visual Insights**: Stacked bar charts showing match vs. base points progression.
- **Elite Performance Split**: Comparison against experts and top performers.
- **Dynamic Community Reveal**: All predictions are revealed once lock time passes, grouped into "Team 1 Supporters" vs "Team 2 Supporters" columns on desktop.
- **Match Scores in Reveal**: Post-match, each user's points awarded (with breakdown tooltip) are shown directly on the prediction card.

### 🤖 Automation & AI Agents
- **Match Stats Agent**: Fetches nightly head-to-head stats, team form, and "players to watch" using Gemini 2.0 Flash with Google Search grounding.
- **Match Result Agent**: Auto-fetches ground truth (winner, POM, scores) when a match status changes to `completed`.
- **n8n + Telegram**: Secure webhook for automated match result ingestion and scoring triggers.

### 🛠 Admin Tools
- **Bulk Match Import**: Upload a CSV to import multiple matches at once. Format: `id,team1,team2,venue,start_time` (sequential IDs 1, 2, 3 are auto-formatted to `tournament-year-number`).
- **Campaign Builder**: Create campaigns with drag-and-drop question ordering, alphabetical option sorting, and configurable selection caps.
- **League Management**: Create leagues, assign admins, manage members, and generate join codes.
- **Manual Results Override**: Set correct answers per question and trigger scoring from the admin panel.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for frontend dev server)
- Google Cloud Project (OAuth credentials)

### 1. Clone & Configure
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd ipl-fantasy
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 2. Start Everything
```bash
./start_all.sh
# Backend:  http://localhost:8000
# Frontend: http://localhost:5000
```

The script:
1. Builds and starts the backend in Docker (with hot-reload via watchfiles)
2. Runs `npm run build` to verify TypeScript, then starts the Vite dev server

### 3. Seed Initial Data
```bash
# Seed the first admin user
docker compose exec backend python seed_admin.py your-email@gmail.com

# (Optional) Seed the AI Assassin competitor
docker compose exec backend python seed_ai.py

# (Optional) Seed match schedule
docker compose exec backend python seed_matches.py
```

### 4. Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Generate a new migration after model changes
docker compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
```

## ⚖️ Scoring Rules (2026 Season)

| Category | Correct | Incorrect |
|---|---|---|
| Match Winner | +10 | −5 |
| Player of the Match | +25 | 0 |
| Powerplay Score (exact) | +15 | — |
| Powerplay Score (±5 range) | +5 | — |
| More Sixes / More Fours | +5 | 0 |
| Non-participation (Match 12+) | — | −5 |
| AI Assassin penalty starts | — | Match 25 |

**Powerup (2× Booster)**: Tracked globally (`User.base_powerups`). Multiplies Winner, POM, and Powerplay points (including negative points/penalties). Does **not** multiply Sixes/Fours.

**Points Breakdown UI Design & Powerups**:
- To maintain mathematical clarity in the UI, the `points_breakdown` JSON stores **unmultiplied base values** (e.g. `10` or `-10`) for each individual question in the rules list.
- Since the frontend displays a dedicated `Powerup Applied (2x)` row at the bottom of the card, showing base values inside the list makes the math clear and avoids looking like a doubled score is being doubled again:
  $$\text{Total Score} = (\text{Sum of base question points}) \times 2$$
  The `total_points` field in the response and database correctly reflects this final multiplied sum.

**Late Entrants**: Protected from retroactive penalties for matches before signup. Can receive a `User.base_points` catch-up handicap applied globally and in private leagues.

---

## 🔑 Key Business Rules

- **Prediction Lock**: 30 minutes before `start_time`. Enforced server-side.
- **Community Reveal**: `GET /matches/{id}/predictions/all` returns HTTP 403 until predictions are locked. Results are segmented by the leagues the requesting user shares with others.
- **Dynamic Questions**: The prediction form and reveal both render questions dynamically from the backend. No hardcoded question IDs on the frontend.
- **Match ID Format**: `tournament-year-number` (e.g., `ipl-2026-42`). Admin bulk import accepts sequential numbers (1, 2, 3) and auto-formats them.

---

## 🔒 Security & Access Control

- **Allowlist Gate**: Only pre-approved emails can log in (Google OAuth).
- **Role Hierarchy**: Super Admin → League Admin → Member → Guest.
- **Guest Mode**: `is_guest=True` users can view but cannot submit predictions. Excluded from the main leaderboard.
- **Telegram Admins**: Users with `is_telegram_admin=True` can submit results via the n8n webhook.
